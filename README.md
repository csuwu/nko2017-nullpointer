            example: (2)pl (1)es   (0)Ap  = Apples <br>
            To arrange these chuncks we have to use git commands as below <br>
            ```git add 0 ```<br>
            ```git add 2 ```<br>
            ```git add 1 ```<br>

* Step 05 : After every word you have to commit your changes using below git command <br>
            ```git commit```<br>
            If your arrangement is correct you will gain marks. If yor arrangement is incorrect you will not gain any mark.
